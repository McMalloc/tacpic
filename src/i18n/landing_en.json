In this way, you build a bridge between sighted and visually impaired people.</1> <2>We are still in the testing phase, so the editor is available to you free of charge. Likewise, at the moment you have the possibility to download the designs for your own production for free. Our goal is to fill the online catalog with the help of the community and to improve the service for you. In a next step it will be necessary to purchase licenses to activate the download function. The editor will be permanently available to you free of charge. You can get more information about the license model here.</2>",
